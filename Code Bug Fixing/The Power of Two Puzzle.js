//Code with error(s):
function isPowerOfTwo(n) {
    
    return n > 0 || (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
}

//Correct Code
function isPowerOfTwo(n) {
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
}

//Certainly! If you want to correct the code while keeping the logical OR (||) operator, you would need to change the condition to check if the given number is both greater than 0 and satisfies the bitwise operation. Here's the corrected code with the logical OR operator:
//This corrected code ensures that n is both greater than 0 (a positive integer) and satisfies the condition for being a power of two using the bitwise AND (&) operation.
